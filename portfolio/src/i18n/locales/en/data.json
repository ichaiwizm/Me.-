      "long": "I'm a full-stack software engineer who lives to build. For several years, I've been designing, developing, and scaling complete applications - from front to backend to infrastructure. Passionate about AI and automation, I integrate these technologies into all my projects to go faster, aim higher, and deliver better.\n\nBut life isn't just code: I value family, travel (between Paris and Jerusalem), and simple moments - a pizza on the roof with city views, a walk in the park, or a fun photo at the aquarium. This balance keeps me motivated and creative.\n\nWhen I'm not coding, I'm still coding - it's simple: I'm launched and I don't stop."
